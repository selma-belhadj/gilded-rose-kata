1. Use let instead of var
    > let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope
2. Variable and function names are written in camelCase
   1. Choose a word with meaning (provide some context)
   2. Attach additional information to a name (use suffix or prefix)
3. Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)
4. you aren’t gonna need it (YAGNI)
5. keep it simple, stupid principle (KISS)
